# **Project - Live Blog**

Hey Folksâ€¦.

This year I've been working on a really exciting projects.. Undergraduate research in Robotics! It's my fourth year of engineering, and I decided to work as a undergraduate researcher in Robotics under the supervision of a professor.



This will be live blog, where I will be writing here about my day to day ramblings, learnings and research while working on research projects at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) in [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/).

# Week 1

This week, I wanted to write about why I decided to do research, and on what problem I'm currently working on.

## What is Undergraduate Research?
An undergraduate research is usually a faculty-mentored, self-directed work that allow us to explore a topic of our interest in-depth and commuicate the results. I primarilyy decided to work on research projects to prepare me to get started on work I might continue in graduate school, hone my research skills, and test out whether academic research is for me.

I will say that undergraduate research also requires considerable amount of work! It definitely requires more work than semester courses, and we will be working so closely with a professor, ther's no way to slack on it or procrastinate. Moreover, I think undergraduate research is an incredible opportunity.

## Flapping Wing UAV
Earlier,  I've worked on some basic projects developing drones, ornithopters, electronics & embedded systems and stuff which I've used to guide high school students in my locality towards STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, & Mathematics) motivated them mathematically and to perform hands-on activities to buld basic drone, robot to carry out science experiments.

Anyway, coming to my current project here, we were working on developing the "Flapping Wing UAV" i.e. building a bird-like drone using polymer-based artificial muscles. Initially, we started design, fabrication of flapping wing UAV to build a quick/rough prototype to make it fly.
