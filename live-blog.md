Hey Folksâ€¦.

This year I've been working on a really exciting projects.. Undergraduate research in Robotics! It's my fourth year of engineering, and I decided to work as a undergraduate researcher in Robotics under the supervision of a professor.



This will be live blog, where I will be writing here about my day to day ramblings, learnings and research while working on research projects at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) in [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/).

Here I'll be writing about why I decided to do research, and on what problem I'm currently working on.

## What is Undergraduate Research?

An undergraduate research is usually a faculty-mentored, self-directed work that allow us to explore a topic of our interest in-depth and commuicate the results. I primarilyy decided to work on research projects to prepare me to get started on work I might continue in graduate school, hone my research skills, and test out whether academic research is for me.

I will say that undergraduate research also requires considerable amount of work! It definitely requires more work than semester courses, and we will be working so closely with a professor, ther's no way to slack on it or procrastinate. Moreover, I think undergraduate research is an incredible opportunity.

## Flapping Wing UAV

Earlier,  I've worked on some basic projects developing drones, ornithopters, electronics & embedded systems and stuff which I've used to guide high school students in my locality towards STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, & Mathematics) motivated them mathematically and to perform hands-on activities to buld basic drone, robot to carry out science experiments.

Anyway, coming to my current project here, we were working on the topic of bio-inspired, autonomous drones focuses on drawing inspiration from biology to "Design, Modeling and control of an Bird-like Autonomous Flapping Wing Robot" to show that it is possible to perform an impressive suite of intelligent behaviors with light-weight and power-efficient sensing, processing and actuation of flapping wing UAV's.
